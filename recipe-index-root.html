I got the idea to make a healthier version of the classic pudding pop from memories of hot summer days when I was growing up. When my sister and I were younger, our goal in life was to catch the ice cream truck. We‚Äôd play outside in the yard with our neighbor friends all day until one of us yelled&nbsp;‚Äússhhhhhhhh!!!!‚Äù and then we‚Äôd all run to opposite ends of the yard to figure out&nbsp;which direction that whimsical sound of&nbsp;The Entertainer was coming from.

I can‚Äôt think of anything as refreshing and hydrating as watermelon, so this cold soup really hits the spot. If it‚Äôs warm where you are, try it ASAP!

We chatted about our shared love for the simple tomato sandwich and how you shouldn‚Äôt complicate things that are as beautiful as summer tomatoes. I forgot that I had this post in the queue ‚Äì because I absolutely LOVE this slightly fancier tomato-with-other-things sandwich. This&nbsp;reminds me of a juicy caprese sandwich except, well, there‚Äôs no cheese here.

How to Make Crostini Crostini may seem fancy, but making them is actually simple. If you‚Äôre not familiar with them, they‚Äôre thin slices of grilled or toasted baguette that are great for serving with a variety of toppings.

You can make it in advance which, in my opinion, is a key element to summer salad-ing. My Tabbouleh Recipe Twist This is not a traditional tabbouleh recipe because, as you see, I‚Äôm using dried tart cherries (which are also sometimes called sour cherries) in lieu of tomatoes.

Even though I developed it years ago now, it‚Äôs still one of my favorite fall and winter recipes. Fresh pumpkin puree (or kabocha or butternut squash) blends with cashews to create a super creamy, super comforting sauce. Yes, it looks like mac and cheese, but this surprising pumpkin pasta sauce is something else entirely. Roasted garlic, onion, and fresh sage give it a nutty, complex autumn flavor. Personally, I think it‚Äôd be a fantastic option for a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner, but it‚Äôs so simple and cozy that you‚Äôll want‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This stuffed poblano peppers recipe might be my new favorite summertime dinner. It has all the best parts of stuffed bell peppers ‚Äì a fresh, flavorful filling, fun garnishes, and juicy roasted peppers ‚Äì but the poblanos add an extra layer of heat. The whole thing is super fresh, super flavorful, and really darn fun to eat. If you‚Äôve never cooked with poblano peppers before, they‚Äôre a chili pepper with a mild to medium heat level. On the Scoville scale, which measures how spicy peppers are, they range from 1,000 to 2,000 Scoville heat units.

You know, the one that includes a morning smoothie instead of a croissant, and light vegetable-packed&nbsp;dinners like this one instead of multi-course dinners with wine pairings.
