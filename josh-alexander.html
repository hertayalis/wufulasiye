It’s natural for people to ask why the couple waited so long to marry. Aya, on the other hand, had no desire to marry because she did not believe in marriage. Josh, on the other hand, was able to persuade her to change her mind. Before taking the big step, they even went to marital therapy.</p><p>“Look, even if we don’t make it, I would have liked to have that experience with you, so let’s have the experience of getting married and being married,” Josh said, prompting Aya to reconsider marriage.</p><p>Aya once told uproxx.com that Josh had never turned her down and had been there for her through thick and thin. Josh assisted in paying for her cavity filling while she was in a less-than-desirable financial situation. It’s no surprise that Aya recalled the incident after all these years.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>and producer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>director</a> <a href=# rel=tag>writer</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rm6CoZpOkunC2zqyfZpmcmsWiusOeqWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./little-elf-net-worth-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;Little Elf Net Worth 2024</a>
