He grew up in a mixed family with Jamaican and Afro-American roots and spent time with his grandmother in Jamaica during his childhood. After returning to New York, he attended George Washington High School and served in the Navy during World War II. Upon completing his service, he worked as a janitor’s assistant until he discovered his passion for theatre.</p><p>Belafonte continued his education at The New School in New York, taking acting classes alongside notable actors such as Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Walter Matthau, Bea Arthur, and Sidney Poitier. He performed with the American Negro Theater and won a Tony Award for his participation in the Broadway revue John Murray Anderson’s Almanac in 1954. He also starred in the Broadway revue 3 for Tonight with Gower Champion in 1955.</p><p>Harry Belafonte also started his music career as a club singer in New York and eventually signed a recording contract with RCA Victor in 1953. He became well-known for introducing various artists to American audiences, including Miriam Makeba and Nana Mouskouri. Belafonte’s album Midnight Special (1962) featured a young Bob Dylan playing harmonica. He also performed during the Rat Pack era in Las Vegas and appeared in several films, including Carmen Jones (1954) and Island in the Sun (1957).</p><p>Belafonte was not only an entertainer but also a prominent civil rights activist who supported the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. He was a confidant of Martin Luther King Jr. and provided financial support to King’s family. He bailed King out of Birmingham City Jail during the 1963 Birmingham Campaign and helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington. Despite being blacklisted during the McCarthy era, Belafonte continued his activism and used his fame to secure several controversial film roles.</p><p>Belafonte’s love for the Caribbean island of Bonaire led him to create a private community named Belnem with Maurice Neme of Oranjestad, Aruba. The neighbourhood is managed by the Bel-Nem Caribbean Development Corporation, where Belafonte served as its first director.</p><p>Harry Belafonte passed away on April 25, 2023, due to congestive heart failure at the age of 96 in his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p><h3><strong>Harry Belafonte Children: Meet Her Daughters And Son</strong></h3><p></p><p>Belafonte had four children in all. He was also married thrice before his death. Harry Belafonte’s first marriage to Byrd lasted from 1948 to 1957, during which they had two daughters named <strong>Adrienne</strong> and <strong>Shari Belafonte</strong>. Despite having two children together, their marriage ended when Byrd was pregnant with Shari. After the divorce, Adrienne and her daughter Rachel Blue founded the Anir Foundation / Experience, aimed at humanitarian work in southern Africa. Shari went on to become a photographer, model, singer, and actress and is married to actor Sam Behrens.</p><p>Harry Belafonte also met Julie Robinson and married her on March 8, 1957. They had two children, <strong>David</strong> and <strong>Gina</strong>. David, the only son of Harry Belafonte, is a former model and actor turned Emmy-winning and Grammy-nominated music producer. He is also the executive director of the family-held company Belafonte Enterprises Inc. As a music producer, David has been involved in most of Belafonte’s albums, tours, and productions. He is married to Malena Belafonte, who toured with Belafonte as a model and singer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Gina Belafonte, on the other hand, followed in her father’s footsteps as an actress and worked with him as a coach and producer on more than six films. She now leads Sankofa, a non-profit established by her father to support political activism in the arts.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC0wKupsmWSmrmiss6nq55lk522rbDRnqVmpZWawW60xKtknZmlnLW1sdGsZJqmlGLAsLqO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./morgan-fairchild.html>&#171;&nbsp;Morgan Fairchild</a>
